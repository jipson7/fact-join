# fact-join

Update from original project to deploy as a flask server.

A simple script that takes two Wikipedia pages from user input or at random, and then merges them to create new facts.

Atlantis + San Francisco

`Despite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in the state of California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City.`

Peacock spiders + the sun

`In at least one species, Maratus vespertilio, the expansion of the flaps also is about 109 times that of Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86 % of the total mass of the Solar System. `

Computer programming + witchcraft

`In general, good programming derives from Old Testament laws against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the Early Modern Period.`
